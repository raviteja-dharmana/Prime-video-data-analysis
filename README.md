# Prime Video Data Analysis (Python + SQL)

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of **Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s** extensive content library using **Python** and **SQL**. By examining over **7,000 entries**, we uncover meaningful insights into content trends, genre popularity, production countries, rating distributions, and more. The analysis emphasizes both programming and query-based approaches for real-world analytics.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw data to address nulls and inconsistencies.
- Perform descriptive analysis using Python and SQL.
- Explore data based on:
  - **Content Type**
  - **Release Year**
  - **Country of Origin**
  - **Rating** and **Genres**
- Engineer meaningful features:
  - **Year Difference** (Release vs. Prime addition year)
  - **Movie Category** (Short, Standard, Long)
  - **Age Suitability** (Kids, Teens, Mature)
- Create compelling visualizations using Python.
- Showcase SQL querying for insights and pattern recognition.

## Dataset

### Source
The dataset contains detailed information about Prime Video titles:

- **Title**: Name of the content.
- **Content Type**: Movie or TV Show.
- **Release Year**: Original release year.
- **Country**: Production country.
- **Rating**: Viewer guidance rating.
- **Duration**: Runtime in minutes or number of seasons.
- **Listed Genres**: Content classification (e.g., Drama, Comedy).

### Processing
- Null values were handled.
- Date fields and categories were standardized.
- The dataset was imported into **MySQL** for query-based analysis.

## Key Highlights

### Insights

- **Content by Country**:
  - The **USA** leads in content volume.
  - **India** and the **UK** also contribute significantly.

- **Popular Genres**:
  - Dominated by **Drama**, **Comedy**, **Action**, and **Thriller**.

- **Content Type Distribution**:
  - **Movies** make up **94.8%** of the dataset.

- **Ratings**:
  - TV Shows: Tend to be family-friendly (PG, TV-G).
  - Movies: More often rated for mature audiences (R, TV-MA).

- **Duration**:
  - Movies vary from short (<60 mins) to extended (>240 mins).
  - Newer content generally has shorter durations.

- **Top Contributors**:
  - **Directors**: Alastair Fothergill, Vikas Bahl
  - **Actors**: Shah Rukh Khan, Al Pacino, Emily Blunt

### Feature Engineering

- **Year Difference**:
  - Time gap between release and Prime Video listing.

- **Movie Category**:
  - **Short**: < 60 mins
  - **Standard**: 60â€“120 mins
  - **Long**: > 120 mins

- **Age Suitability**:
  - **Kids**: G, PG
  - **Teens**: PG-13
  - **Mature**: R, TV-MA

## Visualizations (Python)

- **Bar Charts**: Genre and rating distributions
- **Pie Charts**: Movies vs. TV shows
- **Heatmaps**: Attribute correlations
- **Scatter Plots**: Duration vs. release year

## SQL Analysis

SQL queries were written to:

- Count content by type:
  ```sql
  SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM prime_data GROUP BY type;
  ```
- Most popular genres:
  ```sql
  SELECT listed_in, COUNT(*) as count FROM prime_data GROUP BY listed_in ORDER BY count DESC;
  ```
- Top contributing countries:
  ```sql
  SELECT country, COUNT(*) as count FROM prime_data GROUP BY country ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;
  ```
- Ratings distribution:
  ```sql
  SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM prime_data GROUP BY rating;
  ```
- Longest movies:
  ```sql
  SELECT title, duration FROM prime_data WHERE type='Movie' ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 5;
  ```

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Tools**:
  - **Jupyter Notebook** for Python analysis
  - **MySQL** for database querying
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**, **NumPy**: Data handling
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: Visualization
